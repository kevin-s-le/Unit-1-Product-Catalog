# Unit-1-Product-Catalog
This code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a product catalog. The catalog displays the name, model, cost, and quantity of tech products. The code uses JavaScript to fill the content area. We use const variables to fill in the content within the table, specifically individual ‘product1’, ‘product2’, and ‘product3’. These variables contain static information that auto-populates the table. 

We also can add new products by using the addProduct function.
